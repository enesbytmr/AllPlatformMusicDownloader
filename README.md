# AllPlatformMusic Downloader

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

AllPlatformMusic Downloader is a backend-focused tool that allows users to download music tracks and playlists from multiple platforms (Spotify, YouTube, YouTube Music, SoundCloud, etc.) with high matching accuracy.

Users can upload a `.txt` file listing songs or provide a playlist link, and the system will:

* Search the track across multiple platforms.
* Download the highest-matching version.
* Zip the files and provide the download.
* Clean up the temporary data after download.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

* Automatically find and download music tracks from the best matching platform.
* Cross-platform support for playlist conversion (e.g., Spotify playlists downloaded from YouTube Music).
* Support remix/fallback logic: if original track is not found, try SoundCloud or other platforms.
* Temporary file storage, zip bundling, and auto-deletion logic after user download.

## ðŸ“’ Use Cases

### 1. Download from `.txt` File

User uploads a `.txt` file with each line containing a song name.

* System searches each track across platforms.
* Downloads best match into `temp/` directory.
* After all downloads are complete, creates a `.zip` file.
* Serves the `.zip` to user and deletes all temporary files.

### 2. Download from Playlist Link

User provides a playlist link (e.g., from Spotify):

* System fetches all tracks from the playlist.
* Each track is matched with YouTube Music / SoundCloud alternatives.
* Download and zip process proceeds similarly.

---

## ðŸ”„ Retry & Error Handling

* Each download task includes a `retry_limit` (e.g., 3 tries per track).
* Errors are logged.
* If a track fails to download, it is recorded in a `not_downloaded.txt` file.
* All tasks are handled asynchronously for performance (via asyncio or Celery+Redis).
